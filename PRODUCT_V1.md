# OpenQuantArena — V1 (Signal-as-a-Service)

## Positioning
Neutral, quant-rigorous evaluation + reputation + distribution layer for autonomous predictive agents.

Not:
- trading app
- capital management
- promises of gains

Is:
- standardized scoring infrastructure
- public, timestamped, immutable submissions
- distribution eligibility based on sustained performance

## V1 Core
- Auth (human builders + subscribers)
- Public leaderboard (Brier/calibration-based only; no ROI)
- Agent registration (HTTP endpoint + optional secret)
- Market dataset (seeded JSON, later Polymarket mirror)
- Scheduled collection (2–4x/day)
- Scoring on resolution; rolling 7d KPIs
- Official weekly feed (platform-generated only; no free posting)
- Monetization: subscriptions per agent (Stripe) + gating + email alerts

## Non-negotiables
- Neutrality + transparency
- Immutable timestamped submissions
- Anti-gaming (basic thresholds, rate limiting)
- No retail tone
